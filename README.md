# HTML5-Embedding-Multimedia
Web developers have wanted to use video and audio on the Web for a long time, ever since the early 2000s when we started to have bandwidth fast enough to support any kind of video (video files are much larger than text or even images.) In the early days, native web technologies such as HTML didn't have the ability to embed video and audio on the Web, so proprietary (or plugin-based) technologies like Flash — and later, Silverlight (both of which are now obsolete) — became popular for handling such content. This kind of technology worked ok, but it had a number of problems, including not working well with HTML/CSS features, security issues, and accessibility issues.  A native solution would solve much of this if implemented correctly. Fortunately, a few years later the HTML5 specification had such features added, with the &lt;video> and &lt;audio> elements, and some shiny new JavaScript APIs for controlling them. We'll not be looking at JavaScript here — just the basic foundations that can be achieved with HTML.
